# TFL Colours

A simple snippet of CSS which can brighten up your website when giving complex travel instructions or direction when using public transport in London.

## Installation
### Via a CDN
Just add this line of code into your `<head>`.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/fredbradley/tfl-colours/build/css/style.css" />
``` 
### Via NPM
```bash
npm install @fredbradley/tfl-colours
```
Then in your main JS:
`require('@fredbradley/tfl-colours')`
This method is still a work in progress. See Issue [#1](https://github.com/fredbradley/tfl-colours/issues/1) for more info.

### Copy the code
Alternatively you can just copy the contents of `build/css/style.css` (it's only small). However, you won't have the benefit of any updates being automatically applied.

## Usage / Examples
For example, please checkout the [examples page](https://git.fred.im/tfl-colours).
